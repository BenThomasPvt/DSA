# 📘 DSA-Practice

This repository is where I practice and organize solutions to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems from online coding platforms.  
Currently, I’m solving problems from **HackerRank**, starting with Arrays and gradually covering all core topics.  
Later, I plan to move to **LeetCode** to tackle more advanced and interview-focused problems.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

The goal is to build a consistent habit of solving DSA problems and use this repository to:

- Track progress and organize solutions
- Prepare for interviews (TCS NQT, product-based companies, etc.)
- Build a strong foundation in problem-solving

## 📂 Structure

Solutions are organized like this:

DSA-Practice/
│
├── HackerRank/
│ ├── Arrays/
│ ├── Strings/
│ └── ...more topics
│
└── LeetCode/ ← will be added later
├── Easy/
├── Medium/
└── Hard/

## 📌 Current Status

- ✅ Practicing **Arrays** problems from HackerRank
- ⏳ Planning to move on to **Strings**, **Linked Lists**, etc.
- 🔜 Will start solving LeetCode problems (organized by difficulty and topic)

---

## 💻 Language

- Using **Python** for most problems
- May occasionally use **C++** or **Java**

---

## 🏁 Final Goal

Solve 300+ problems across platforms and topics, covering:

- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Recursion, DP, and more
- With well-commented code and structured folders for easy reference

> 📅 This repo will grow over time as I continue solving new problems regularly.
